\title{Determine the path between two varieties}
\usage{
getPath(v1, v2, ig, geneal, colName, silent = FALSE,
  isDirected = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{v1}{the label of the first vertex of interest (in character string format)}

\item{v2}{the label of the second vertex of interest (in character string format)}

\item{ig}{the graph representation of the data genealogy (in igraph format)}

\item{geneal}{the full genealogy  (in data frame format)}

\item{colName}{the name of the column of the data frame that contains the quantitative variable of interest (in character string format)}

\item{silent}{whether or not to print output (defaults to false)}

\item{isDirected}{whether or not the graph is directed (defaults to false)}
}
\description{
Determines the shortest path between the two inputted vertices, and takes into
account whether or not the graph is directed. If there is a path, the list of vertices of the
path will be returned. If there is not a path, a list of character(0) will be returned. Note:
For a directed graph, the direction matters. However, this function will check both directions
and return the path if it exists.

data(sbGeneal)
ig <- dfToIG(sbGeneal)
getPath("Brim", "Bedford", ig, sbGeneal, "devYear")
getPath("Tokyo", "Volstate", ig, sbGeneal, "yield")
